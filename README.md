A large dataset of 4177 observations with 8 physical measurements of Abalones have been taken and an analysis has been performed on the data using various 
statistical methods like "Simple Linear Regression", "CLustering", "Logistic Regression", and "Poisson Regression" have been used in order to predict a model
to determine the number of rings in the shell to acquire the age of the abalones.
